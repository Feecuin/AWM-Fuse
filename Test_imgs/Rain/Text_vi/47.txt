The image depicts a dimly lit street scene under heavy rainfall, resulting in reduced visibility and softening of details due to the rain streaks. A red vehicle is stationed in the background, partially obscured by the rain. On the right side, near the edge of the road, a figure appears to be walking partially sheltered, indicated by a blurred silhouette. The ambient light creates a reflection on the wet pavement, adding to the atmospheric mood of the scene. The image degradation is primarily characterized by motion blur and the dense vertical streaks of rain which distort and obscure the clarity of the objects, especially in the distance and along the peripheral areas. Moreover, uneven lighting from overhead sources creates contrast with darker overhangs and illuminated roadway, contributing to the overall moody and immersive urban environment.
