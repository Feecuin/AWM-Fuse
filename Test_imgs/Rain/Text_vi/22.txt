The image depicts a nocturnal street scene obscured by heavy rain, which creates vertical streaks throughout the composition. Illumination is provided by a street lamp on the left, casting a pale glow over the wet surface of the road and highlighting a nearby tree and its leaves. This lighting also reveals a "Yield" traffic sign, positioned close to the street lamp. The road appears to curve or shift direction near the image's center, and faint outlines suggest a sidewalk and additional road markings. In the background, indistinct shapes of buildings or structures are visible, partially veiled by the combination of rain and darkness. The overall clarity of the image is reduced due to the rain effect, adding a diffuse, misty quality that softens the focus on distant objects.
