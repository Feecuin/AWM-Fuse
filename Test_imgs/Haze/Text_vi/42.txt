The image depicts a street scene enveloped in a thick layer of fog, resulting in significant visual degradation of objects further in the distance. On the left side of the image, tall trees with sparse, autumnal foliage line the walkway. The ground is covered with fallen leaves, creating a scattered pattern across the pavement. A manhole cover is visible on the pavement's surface, reflecting some light. On the right side, a row of parked bicycles is partially obscured by the fog, which becomes denser further down the street, reducing visibility. Two figures are visible; one to the mid-right foreground, walking towards the viewer, and another further down the street, barely discernible through the haze. The fog creates a gradient of visibility, with clarity diminishing toward the center of the image, giving the scene a serene yet enigmatic atmosphere.
